## 4. Functional Requirements

| Module               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| User Authentication  | Register and login users, manage sessions        |
| Product Browsing     | Show products from database dynamically          |
| Shopping Cart        | Add/remove items, update quantities              |
| Checkout             | Collect user details, process orders             |
| Order Handling       | Save orders into database                        |
| Contact Page         | Possibly a form for customer support             |
| Product Details Page | Show images and descriptions                     |

## 5. Database Design

Expected tables from `327_Table Create.sql`:

- `users`
- `products`
- `orders`
- `order_items`

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Load featured products quickly on homepage
- **Security:** Passwords should be hashed (TBD if done)
- **Scalability:** Basic version; can scale with category-based filtering
- **Responsiveness:** Uses CSS, check if media queries or frameworks are applied

---

## 7. Assumptions & Limitations

- Admin panel not included or visible in current structure
- Product catalog is fixed unless database updated manually
- Image assets are served statically

---

## 8. Future Enhancements

- Add admin dashboard
- Include search and filter options
- Integrate payment gateway
- Add email notifications for orders
